# Horiseon Digital Marketing Website Code-Cleanup

## Description

This project was deployed in order to ensure that the codebase of the Horiseon website follows accessibility standards and to ensure that the site can be optimized for search engines 

- The motivation was to help users locate the website from search engines with greater ease as well as to enhance overall user experience of the website. This project was also done in order to help Horiseon promote as well as provide information regarding their social media marketing services
- This project was done specifically to solve the issues that website is currently facing which includes non-accessibility for the visually impaired as well as a broken link in the header. 
- Now, the website meets accessibility standards in regards to its visual media content
- I learned that adding semantic HTML elements to the basecode is very important, the function of HREF, the purpose of the alt tag, and how to add a title element
- User story and Acceptance Criteria have been met
